                    <h4>Legal Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ben Mak: CORRECT</strong> - Provided clear medical justification with documented pediatrician appreciation</p>
                    <p><strong>Judge: INCORRECT</strong> - Systematically dismissed child welfare evidence without proper consideration</p>
                    
                    <h5>Statutory Framework</h5>
                    <p><strong>Children Act 1989, Section 1(1):</strong> Child's welfare is paramount consideration in all court decisions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Children Act 1989, Section 1(3)(a):</strong> Court must consider ascertainable wishes and feelings of child.</p>
                    <p><strong>Children Act 1989, Section 10:</strong> Applications for orders - sufficient interest test for extended family.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Family Procedural Rules</h5>
                    <p><strong>FPR 12.3:</strong> Sufficient interest test - functional parenting relationships have legal weight.</p>
                    <p><strong>FPR 12.14:</strong> Case management - court's duty to further child's welfare.</p>
                    <p><strong>FPR 12.21:</strong> Separate representation for children - emotional attachment considerations.</p>
                    <p><strong>FPR 12.73:</strong> Court must consider all relevant evidence before making welfare determinations.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Case Law Authority</h5>
                    <p><strong>Re H (Minors) [1991] 2 AC 15:</strong> Functional parenting relationships have legal weight regardless of formal status.</p>
                    <p><strong>Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146:</strong> Mandatory kinship assessment before removal - court failed to ensure assessment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Re C (A Child) [2016] EWCA Civ 374:</strong> Family separation must be last resort after considering all alternatives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Re W (A Child) [2016] EWCA Civ 1140:</strong> Unique kinship bonds must be respected in welfare analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965:</strong> Procedural requirements cannot override child welfare evidence.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Application to Ben's Case</h5>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 1:</strong> Judge dismissed locus parentis doctrine without considering functional parenting evidence (Re H authority).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 2:</strong> Mandatory kinship assessment never conducted despite 3-year care relationship (Re B-S authority).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 3:</strong> Family bonds paramount principle ignored without welfare analysis (Children Act s1).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 4:</strong> Available support dismissed without assessment (Re C authority - last resort).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 5:</strong> Child's distress signals (hair-pulling, emotional attachment) ignored (s1(3)(a) requirement).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 6:</strong> Procedural barriers prioritized over child welfare evidence (Re G authority).</p>
                    <p><strong>SEGMENT 7:</strong> Maria Moore's procedural failures acknowledged but consequences ignored.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Final Conclusion</h5>
                    <p><strong>EGGSHELL SKULL PRINCIPLE:</strong> Abel's autism condition required specialized family support that typical children would not need.</p>
                    <p><strong>BUT FOR TEST:</strong> But for the judge's systematic dismissal, Ben's proven care relationship would have prevented family separation.</p>
                    <p><strong>FORESEEABILITY:</strong> Dismissing child welfare evidence without assessment foreseeably harms vulnerable children.</p>
                    <p><strong>PREVENTABILITY:</strong> Following mandatory assessment procedures would have prevented separation trauma.</p>
                    <p><strong>BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT:</strong> Abel's physical distress (hair-pulling) and emotional attachment prove welfare compromise.</p>
                    <p><strong>COMPENSATION DUE:</strong> Systematic dismissal of child's voice causing separation trauma establishes damages for psychological harm and lost family relationships.</p>
